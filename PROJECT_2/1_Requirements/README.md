Here the bi-directional communication takes place in between the keyfob and the car. As we have seen the unidirectional in Remote Keyless Entry(RKE), now in BiCom system we will witness bi-directional i.e.., information from keyfob to car viceversa. The status of the car will also be displayed on the keyfob by LED or display.

The main focus of this BiCom is to operate the car's window , alarm , battery and door. The frequency set in the RKE will be matched with the car as per requirements set in the code. A security code shall be fixed which ensures security to the car. As the technology is increasing rapidly these kind of automations are very useful in our daily lives.
