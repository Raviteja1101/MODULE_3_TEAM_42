# BiCom System

## DESCRIPTION:
_The BiCom system is the extention of the unidirectional Remote Keyless Entry(RKE) to bidirectional Remote Keyless Entry system. Here the bi-directional communication takes place in between the keyfob and the car. As we have seen the unidirectional in Remote Keyless Entry(RKE), now in BiCom system we will witness bi-directional i.e.., information from keyfob to car viceversa. The status of the car will also be displayed on the keyfob by LED or display._ 

_The main focus of this BiCom is to operate the car's window , alarm , battery and door. The frequency set in the RKE will be matched with the car as per requirements set in the code. A security code shall be fixed which ensures security to the car. As the technology is increasing rapidly these kind of automations are very useful in our daily lives._
